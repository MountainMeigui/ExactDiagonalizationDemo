## First Prompt - creating the basis

Hi! can you write me a struct of a many body fermionic basis with every state represented by an integer, and each bit represents a population of a state with angular momentum ranging from m_min to m_max, with a fixed number of particles N, where the total angular momentum is a fixed number M?
